## About

This was a quick mock-up application written for `The Iconic Hackathon March 2022` that displays recommendations to a user on the check-out page. The premise is that a user may not see the campaign savings available to them and now they have the opportunity to add items to their cart which may allow them to get more items at a very discounted price.

The example used is:

* Their current cart is set to `$74.96` but there is a campaign of `SPEND $100 SAVE 25%`.
* They then notice the `Mardi Gras - Rainbow Crossbody Bag` in recommendations and add it to the cart. Total is now set to `$89.95`.
* Then they notice `King Habits Socks` in recommendations and add that to the cart.
* Total is now `$78.70`.

They now have 3 items in their cart for an extra `$3.74`. Instead of only the 1 item, they get an extra bag and pair of socks. Amazing!

In a real-world application, recommendations would probably be user-specific.
